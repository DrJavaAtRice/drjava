/**
 * <p>A utility class providing the core functionality of {@code javax.swing.SwingWorker} (first available
 * in Java 6), in addition to supporting the IncrementalTaskController interface.  Allows a task to be
 * separated into two parts: a working portion that calculates a value (or sequence of intermediate values)
 * in the background, and a GUI portion that executes in the Swing event thread when the working portion is
 * complete.  Implementations should define {@link #doInBackground} and, optionally, {@link #process}
 * and {@link #done}.  The {@code doInBackground()} implementation may call {@link #publish}
 * and {@link #authorizeContinue}; other protected methods should generally be ignored as implementation
 * details.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Implementations should be able to migrate seamlessly to the Java 6 API version by simply changing
 * the parent class, as long as they stick to methods that are defined in both classes.  This version doesn't
 * support PropertyChangeListeners, a progress property, the Runnable interface, a {@code getState()} method
 * (although {@code status()} provides similar information), or an {@code isCancelled()} method that can be 
 * polled by {@code doInBackground()} ({@code isCancelled()} is defined, but its result is never 
 * {@code true} before {@code doInBackground()} returns; implementations should instead handle cancellation
 * by checking for an interrupt).  There is also (currently) no thread pooling &mdash;
 * each worker runs in a new thread.  This version <em>adds</em> the methods provided by
 * IncrementalTaskController, as well as {@link #authorizeContinue}, which supports the implementation
 * of {@link #pause}.</p>
