/** Main controller class for DrJava.  This class sets up all of the appropriate cross-references between components at 
  * runtime.  Almost all of the functionality of DrJava is hidden in components with extremely high-level interfaces.
  * This class ensures that each component is registered with all other components that need to call its methods.  In 
  * essence, this class manages component associations.  Any details more low-level than who talks to who should be
  * handled by components through their interfaces.
  * @version $Id$
