  This package provides a framework for abstracting platform-specific calls
  away from the platform-independent DrJava codebase.  The main code tree
  contains platform-independent code to access and execute the platform-specific
  implementations, which are kept in separate code trees.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>PlatformSupport</code> interface defines the calls which must be
  supported by all platform implementations.  <code>DefaultPlatform</code>
  provides a platform-independent implementation.  For convenience, all platform
  implementations extend <code>DefaultPlatform</code>, inheriting default
  implementations for all methods that are not tailored for that platform.
  <code>PlatformFactory</code> is a factory class which contains all logic for
  identifying the host platform and instantiating the appropriate 
  <code>PlatformSupport</code> implementation.  This is performed statically,
  and the result is stored as a singleton field for easy access.  Client
  code can access platform-specific calls like so: 
  <code>PlatformFactory.ONLY.method()</code>.  <code>PlatformFactory</code>
  currently differentiates between Windows, Mac OS X, and the default platform.  
  Note that in order to reference a new platform implementation, it must already 
  be compiled and added to the classpath.  The current platforms are built 
  with special ant targets which add the class files to platforms.jar in the 
  lib directory.
</p>
<p>
  In order to add a new platform-specific feature to DrJava, you must follow
  these steps:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Add a new method to <code>PlatformSupport</code>.  Make sure it is
      properly documented.
    </li>
    <li>
      Provide a default implementation in <code>DefaultPlatform</code>.  Often
      this will be an empty method body.  Document why it does what it does (or
      doesn't).
    </li>
    <li>
      Privode a platform-specific implementation for the necessary platforms.
      Platforms which will use the default method do not need to be modified.
    </li>
    <li>
      Write a test case that reveals the platform-specific behavior, or ensures
      that all platforms produce expected results.
    </li>
    <li>
      Rebuild the modified platform code using the appropriate systems.
    </li>
  </ol>
