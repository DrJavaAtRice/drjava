The <code>model</code> package is responsible for the majority of the logic
and state in DrJava.

It is independent of the presentation, allowing different user interfaces
to be created for the same codebase.  The interfaces and classes in this
package maintain the state of all open documents, interface to the compiler
and interaction components, and communicate with the user interface through
public methods and <code>GlobalModelListeners</code>.
<p>

<h3>GlobalModel's Role</h3><p>
The <code>GlobalModel</code> is the central point of DrJava, coordinating
all components and communicating with the user interface.
<p>

To maintain state, the <code>GlobalModel</code> keeps a list of the
<code>OpenDefinitionsDocuments</code>, each of which is responsible for its
own <code>DefinitionsDocument</code> object and document specific actions
on that object, such as saving and compiling.
<p>

The <code>GlobalModel</code> also provides a set of public methods which
allow it to communicate with the user interface.  This gives the
<code>ui</code> package access to the <code>OpenDefinitionsDocuments</code>,
compiler, console, and interactions code.
<p>

To keep the user interface up-to-date, the <code>GlobalModel</code> fires
events to all <code>GlobalModelListeners</code> which have registered with
it.  Events are fired after actions which can affect the user interface, such
as the opening, saving, and closing of files, or the starting and ending
of compilation or interaction.
<p>

<h3>Subpackages</h3><p>
<ul>
  <li>The <code>compiler</code> package provides an interface between the
      <code>model</code> and the available compilers, allowing DrJava to
      compile documents and maintain any errors produced as a result.
      
  <li>The <code>definitions</code> package provides the model of the documents
      and editor kit, as well as the <code>reducedmodel</code> package for
      lightweight representation of a document for easy parenthesis matching
      and similar syntactic features.

  <li>The <code>repl</code> package contains the classes used for the
      Interactions window, allowing the dynamic execution of Java code
      from within DrJava.

</ul>
