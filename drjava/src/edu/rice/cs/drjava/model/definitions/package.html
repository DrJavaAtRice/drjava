  Provides the data model for storing Java source code.

  The primary class here is {@link
  edu.rice.cs.drjava.model.definitions.DefinitionsDocument}. This is
  an extension of {@link javax.swing.text.PlainDocument} that contains
  a "reduced model", which allows the ability to match parentheses, do
  indentation, and highlight various kinds of text (syntactically)
  very efficiently.
