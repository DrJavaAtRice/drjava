/** * This exception is to be thrown when an <code>OpenDefinitionsDocument</code> 
 * was asked for its DefinitionsDocument and when the <code>OpenDefinitionsDocument</code>
 * itself is not registered in the Document Cache.  This could happen either if the
 * <code>OpenDefinitionsDocument</code> was not correctly initialized (unlikely) or if
 * the document was asked for after the <code>OpenDefinitionsDocument</code> was 
 * explicitly closed by calling <code><i>doc</i>.close()</code>.  For example, this
 * exception is caught when changing the active definitions pane after the active pane
 * had been closed (MainFrame.java).
