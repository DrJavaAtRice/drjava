/** Keeps track of all listeners to an InteractionsModel, and has the ability to notify them of some event. <p>
  * This class has a specific role of managing InteractionsListeners.  Other classes with similar names use similar 
  * code to perform the same function for other interfaces, e.g. JavadocEventNotifier and GlobalEventNotifier.
  * These classes implement the appropriate interface definition so that they can be used transparently as composite 
  * packaging for a particular listener interface. <p>
  * Components which might otherwise manage their own list of listeners use EventNotifiers instead to simplify their 
  * internal implementation.  Notifiers should therefore be considered a private implementation detail of the
  * components, and should not be used directly outside of the "host" component. <p>
  * All methods in this class must use the synchronization methods provided by ReaderWriterLock.  This ensures 
  * that multiple notifications (reads) can occur simultaneously, but only one thread can be adding or removing 
  * listeners (writing) at a time, and no reads can occur during a write. <p>
  * <i>No</i> methods on this class should be synchronized using traditional Java synchronization! <p>
