/** Keeps track of all listeners to a Debugger, and has the ability  to notify them of some event.
 *  <p>
 *  This class has a specific role of managing DebugListeners.  Other classes with similar names use similar code to 
 *  perform the same function for other interfaces, e.g. InteractionsEventNotifier and GlobalEventNotifier.  These 
 *  classes implement the appropriate interface definition so that they can be used transparently as composite packaging
 *  for a particular listener interface.
 *  <p>
 *  Components which might otherwise manage their own list of listeners use EventNotifiers instead to simplify their 
 *  internal implementation.  Notifiers should therefore be considered a private implementation detail of the 
 *  components, and should not be used directly outside of the "host" component.
 *  <p>
 *  All methods in this class must use the synchronization methods provided by ReaderWriterLock.  This ensures that
 *  multiple notifications (reads) can occur simultaneously, but only one thread can be adding or removing listeners 
 *  (writing) at a time, and no reads can occur during a write.
 *  <p>
 *  <i>No</i> methods on this class should be synchronized using traditional Java synchronization!
 *  <p>
