    "1. DEFINITIONS\n" +
    "\n" +
    "\"Contribution\" means:\n" +
    "\n" +
    "a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed " +
    "under this Agreement, and\n" +
    "\n" +
    "b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n" +
    "\n" +
    "i) changes to the Program, and\n" +
    "\n" +
    "ii) additions to the Program;\n" +
    "\n" +
    "where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by " +
    "that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added " +
    "to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. " +
    "Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of " +
    "software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, " +
    "and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily " +
    "infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all " +
    "Contributors.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n" +
    "\n" +
    "a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a " +
    "non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare " +
    "derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense " +
    "the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source " +
    "code and object code form.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a " +
    "non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, " +
    "use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such " +
    "Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall " +
    "apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the " +
    "Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes " +
    "such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not " +
    "apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se " +
    "is licensed hereunder.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its " +
    "Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that " +
    "the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of " +
    "any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims " +
    "brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights " +
    "or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, " +
    "each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual " +
    "property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is " +
    "required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility " +
    "to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright " +
    "rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in " +
    "this Agreement.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "3. REQUIREMENTS\n" +
    "\n" +
    "A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its " +
    "own license agreement, provided that:\n" +
    "\n" +
    "a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n" +
    "\n" +
    "b) its license agreement:\n" +
    "\n" +
    "i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, " +
    "express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, " +
    "and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular " +
    "purpose;\n" +
    "\n" +
    "ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, " +
    "including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as " +
    "lost profits;\n" +
    "\n" +
    "iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by " +
    "that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n" +
    "\n" +
    "iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and " +
    "informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium " +
    "customarily used for software exchange.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "When the Program is made available in source code form:\n" +
    "\n" +
    "a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n" +
    "\n" +
    "b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the " +
    "Program.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if " +
    "any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the " +
    "originator of the Contribution.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with " +
    "respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended " +
    "to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the " +
    "Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not " +
    "create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor " +
    "includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor " +
    "(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other " +
    "Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs " +
    "(collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions " +
    "brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused " +
    "by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its " +
    "distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in " +
    "this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or " +
    "alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified " +
    "Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of " +
    "such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with " +
    "the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. " +
    "The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product " +
    "offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that " +
    "Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related " +
    "to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial " +
    "Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor " +
    "would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those " +
    "performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor " +
    "to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n" +
    "\n" +
