The <code>ui</code> package contains classes for the default user interface
for DrJava.

The interface allows multiple documents to be open, but requires that exactly
one document is active at any time, since only one document is displayed in
the GUI.  This is enforced by subclassing the
<code>DefaultGlobalModel</code> in the <code>model</code> package to add
additional constraints to the logic and state of DrJava, while maintaining
the separation from the pure user interface classes.
<p>

<h3>Additional Logic</h3><p>
The <code>SingleDisplayModel</code> is a subclass of
<code>DefaultGlobalModel</code>, primarily providing the constraint that
exactly one document is active at any time.  It adds public methods for
getting and setting the currently active document to the interface provided
by <code>GlobalModel</code>, and fires a corresponding event through the
<code>SingleDisplayModelListener</code> class, which is a subclass of
<code>GlobalModelListener</code>.
<p>

Note that this behavior is not included in the
<code>DefaultGlobalModel</code> because the notion of a single active document
is specific to this user interface.  Alternative GUIs might choose to display
multiple documents simultaneously, eliminating the need for this additional
constraint.  Housing this logic in a subclass of
<code>DefaultGlobalModel</code>, rather than in <code>MainFrame</code> itself,
allows us to verify through unit tests that only one document can be active.
<p>

<h3>User Interface</h3><p>
The graphical user interface is implemented in Swing and is coordinated
through the <code>MainFrame</code> class.  The general layout and primary
components of the interface are shown in the image below.

<h3>MainFrame</h3><p>
The <code>MainFrame</code> is the <code>JFrame</code> which houses all
other components of the GUI.  It is solely a means of displaying the
state and logic kept within its <code>SingleDisplayModel</code>, and
maintains as little state of its own as possible.  The
<code>MainFrame</code> consists of a <code>JMenuBar</code> containing the
menus, current filename, and toolbar buttons, together with a collection
of panes for displaying the various components of DrJava.  These include
a scrollable <code>JList</code> with the <code>OpenDefinitionDocuments</code>,
a <code>DefinitionsPane</code> for displaying and editing the source code,
and a tabbed pane at the bottom which houses the
<code>InteractionsPane</code>, <code>CompilerErrorPanel</code>, and
<code>OutputPane</code>.
<p>

In addition to setting up the GUI and passing action requests to the
model, <code>MainFrame</code> is also responsible for listening to
events fired by both the <code>GlobalModel</code> and the document
itself, in order to keep the display current.
<p>


<h3>Other Components</h3><p>
<ul>
  <li>The primary GUI component outside the <code>MainFrame</code> is the
      <code>DefinitionsPane</code>, which is a <code>JEditorPane</code> that
      is tied to a specific <code>OpenDefinitionsDocument</code> in the
      model.  This pane handles all highlighting and text indenting for its
      document, as well as undoing actions specific to the document.

  <li>The <code>InteractionsPane</code> is held in the tabbed pane at the
      bottom of the interface and provides the actual interaction with the
      <code>repl</code> interpreter within the <code>GlobalModel</code>.

  <li>The <code>CompilerErrorPanel</code> is another tab in the tabbed pane,
      and contains both a <code>JComboBox</code> for selecting the compiler
      and an <code>ErrorListPane</code> for displaying all the errors from
      the most recent compilation, sorted by document.  The
      <code>ErrorListPane</code> is an inner class of
      <code>CompilerErrorPanel</code>, and is responsible for highlighting
      errors in the list and in the source consistently.

  <li>The <code>OutputPane</code> is the third tab in the tabbed pane, and
      is simply where <code>System.out</code> and <code>System.err</code>
      are redirected when DrJava is run.

  <li>The <code>FindReplaceDialog</code> is a separate <code>JDialog</code>
      which handles the logic and state of finding and replacing text in the
      code, including highlighting and changing the source position as
      necessary.  Only one <code>FindReplaceDialog</code> exists in the GUI,
      and it must be notified each time the active document is changed.
</ul>
