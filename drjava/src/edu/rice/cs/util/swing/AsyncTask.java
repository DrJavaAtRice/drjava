/** * The AsyncTask base class is a framework that facilitates execution of
 * operations asynchronously in order to free up the event-handling thread. This
 * task is passed to an implementation of the AsyncTaskLauncher to be run.
 * <p>
 * Any code that should be performed in asynchronously with the UI should be put
 * in the <code>runAsync</code> method. Any code that is run in this method
 * should NOT modify any Swing components at all. All modifications to Swing
 * components must either be enqueued on the event-handling thread or performed
 * in the <code>complete</code> method. If there is any data that must be
 * passed from the asynchronous step to the completion step, it should be
 * returned by the <code>runAsync</code> method. The same data returned by the
 * <code>runAsync</code> method will be given to the <code>complete</code>
 * method. In short, implementations of an AsyncTask need not manage the
 * information passing between the task thread and the UI thread.
 * <p>
 * The <code>runAsync</code> method is given a progress monitor in order for
 * the task to provide feedback to the user as to the progress of the task. The
 * min and max values for the progress are specified by the
 * <code>getMinProgress</code> and <code>getMaxProgress</code> methods in
 * the task.
