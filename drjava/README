QuickStart Guide For Building DrJava
  by Corky Cartwright (cork@rice.edu)

The following guide presumes that you already have the following
software systems installed on your system and accessible via your 
shell search path:

* Java 8.0 SDK, 
* ant 1.7 or above, and 
* Git (git) 2.7.4 or above.

If not, follow the instructions at http://www.drjava.org/devdocs/ for
setting up a DrJava development environment.

1) Make a directory to be the top-level container for you drjava code
   tree.  I recommend "dj" or "drjava-top.

2) Descend into this new directory by typing the command

   cd ~/dj

3) Download the drjava source code base by typing the command

   git clone https://github.com/DrJavaAtRice/drjava.git

   You can grab the URL (beginning with "https") at 

   https://github.com/DrJavaAtRice/drjava

   and clicking on the green button labeled "Clone or download".

4) After this download completes, descend into the root directory of
   the dowloaded code base by typing the command

   cd drjava

5) To compile the code base and generate a jar file containing the
   compiled program, enter the command

   ant jar

   which builds a jar filed named drjava.jar

If the build is successful, you can execute the built program by
entering the command

  java -jar drjava.jar

If you encounter any problems, consult the Developer Docs at
drjava.org by visiting http://www.drjava.org/devdocs/.

You can run the unit tests by entering the command

  ant test

To delete all compiled and unjarred class files (from jar files in 
drjava/lib and drjava/lib/buildlib), enter the command

  ant clean
